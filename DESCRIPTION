Description: Investigators in single-cell experiments generally wish to maximize
    their power to detect effects, such as associating a disease with the
    frequency of a cell-state. The scPOST famework allows investigators to simulate
    new single-cell datasets from input data in order to mimic their planned experimental
    setting. scPOST allows users to modify their study design so that they may learn how
    changing their study design will affect their power to detect shifts in cell-state
    frequencies across conditions (e.g. case-control status).
